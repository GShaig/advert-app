            <p class="h5">- Carefully evaluate the hosting types and choose the best one for your needs. Think about what kind of hosting plan you need: shared hosting, VPS or dedicated server hosting. It mostly depends on what degree of freedom you need. Whether you wish to use a content management system or you are a developer and want to develop your own website.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Decide which CMS (content management system) to use. If you are thinking about using a content management system, decide which CMS is the most suitable for your needs. The most popular content management systems are <b>WordPress</b>, <b>Joomla</b>, <b>Drupal</b>, and <b>Magento</b>. Evaluate each one carefully. Read the reviews for each CMS.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Check the offered storage type and size. You need to know what type of and what size of storage you need. There mainly two types of storages: HDD and SSD. SSD is the relatively new technology and provides higher performance in terms of read and write processing speeds. The size of your storage depends on whether your website will be content heavy or light content will be enough for you.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Check the bandwidth and monthly visitor limits. Most of the web hosting providers apply a bandwidth or monthly visitor limits on your hosting plan. Check the numbers for those services. If you expect a high number of visitors each month or you think that the bandwidth limit is not enough for you, evaluate your other options.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Evaluate the offered CPU and RAM. This option is for VPS (Virtual Private Network) or dedicated server hosting plans. They usually specify the number of included CPU or vCPU cores and the size of RAM memory they offer in the package. Read the details carefully and make your decision according to your needs.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Evaluate the other included features such as an SSL certificate or CDN (Content Delivery Network). Usually web hosting providers include many features in their hosting plans in order to make the packages attractive for potential customers. If you need a content delivery network for your website, choose the hosting provider who includes CDN in the hosting plan.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Compare the plan prices. Of course the price is always important. Choose a hosting plan within the price range for that hosting type. For cloud hosting plans, check their price for every service. They usually charge you per service, per hour or per request made.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Check the hosting provider. To choose a hosting provider is very critical decision in terms of your website security and performance. Especially if you are buying a shared hosting plan, go with a trusted hosting provider. Otherwise, you will risk your security and the performance of your website.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">All the steps to follow when buying a web hosting plan.</h2>
            <p class="h5">1. Evaluate your situation carefully and choose the correct type of web hosting for your project. Take into consideration above tips when doing your research.</p>
            <p class="h5">2. The second important step is to make decision on your web hosting provider. Analyze the plans offered from each service provider you can find online. Check included items and services in each plan to have a better idea about choosing your hosting provider.</p>
            <p class="h5">3. Enter the website of your preferred web hosting provider and select the hosting plan you wish to buy. Click on <b>Buy Now</b> button to initiate your purchase process.</p>
            <p class="h5">4. Choose for how many years you want to get your hosting plan. It usually varies between 1 and 5 years. Then check the included products in your package and make the necessary adjustments for each product (domain name, SSL certificate etc.).</p>
            <p class="h5">5. Fill out the registration form for your web hosting service. Please be careful about choosing your web server location if the service provider offers different server location for your hosting service. Tip: Take into account your target audience when choosing your web server location.</p>
            <p class="h5">6. Select the payment method you wish to continue with and enter your payment details. Press the <b>BUY</b> or <b>Submit</b> button at the end of the form.</p>
            <p class="h5">7. After your purchase, you will receive a confirmation email usually in a couple of hours. Some service providers do not send a confirmation email but it is a good idea to contact the service provider if you do not get your confirmation email within a day.</p>
            <p class="h5">8. Head to your dashboard on the website of your service provider. This dashboard will be shown after you log in to your account with the credentials you provided during your sign up for your web hosting service.</p>
            <p class="h5">9. In your dashboard, complete your setup and preferences for your hosting server. After this step, you will have your web space and you will be able to access the file directory for your server. Then you can install your preferred content management system on your server if you wish to manage your website with a CMS.</p>
