            <p class="h5">
                <b>ChatGPT</b> is a language model which uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand the queries coming from the users and respond those queries in an appropriate way.
                It is build by using artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies and trained for deep learning algorithms to improve itself continuously.
                ChatGPT analyses the received messages and responds to them just like a human. ChatGPT was developed by <b>OpenAI</b>, which is one of the reputed artificial intelligence institutions in the world.
                When ChatGPT had been released first, it was based on GPT 3.5 architecture. But OpenAI has announced the new version of GPT soon after, <b>GPT 4</b> which was introduced on 14th of March in 2023.
                ChatGPT got the information about many books, websites, newspapers, and events. But it has limited information about the events happened after 2021, as stated by OpenAI.

                Then you will be prompted to the signup form. Fill in the form with the relevant information such as your full name and email address.

                This is just like a security measure to protect ChatGPT website from spammers. In a minute, you will receive an SMS with the verification code to verify your mobile number on the website.

            <h2 class="text-primary">How does ChatGPT work?</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                ChatGPT has a chat interface like in any social media platform people talk on a daily basis. But this chat is a little different.
                It functions like a <b>Google</b> search. You are free to ask any information you would like to know about or request any task you wish the ChatGPT to do for you.
                ChatGPT can answer your questions, write blog articles for you, or develop a script for you to host on your website for your users.
                All you need to do to write a question for ChatGPT, which we call it a <b>Prompt</b>, send it and wait for ChatGPT to generate the answer to your question.
                It usually takes a couple of seconds to generate the response, but it can take longer than that if a heavy workload request was sent by the user.
                The response will be generated step by step and slowly, so be patient until the ChatGPT finishes its response.

            <h2 class="text-primary">Is ChatGPT free to use?</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                Using ChatGPT is free of charge as of March 2023. But we do not know if it will be a paid service in the future or not.
                There is a paid version of the app which called ChatGPT Plus. ChatGPT Plus provides below advantages as compared to the free version of the application:
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="h5">-	Availability to use ChatGPT even there is a high demand on the Internet.</p>
            <p class="h5">-	Get faster responses to your prompts in comparison with the free version of ChatGPT.</p>
            <p class="h5">-	Get access to the premium features and updates before they are officially introduced to the public.</p>
            <br/>
            <p class="h5">Please note that as a free user you will not be able to use ChatGPT during the peak hours.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">What can you do with ChatGPT?</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                -	One of the revolutionary features of ChatGPT is that it can generate codes and scripts in different programming languages for performing vast variety of tasks.
                    For example, you can ask ChatGPT to develop a script for URL shortener service in Python language.
                    You can then ask it to develop an interface for your URL shortener to make it accessible for your users.
                    After that, you just need to make the necessary configuration to be able to host the whole application on your website.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="h5">
                -	Ask ChatGPT to write a blog article for you about a specific topic. It will generate the article in a couple of seconds with all the relevant sub headings.
                    Just do not forget to pass all the necessary keywords for your article when you write a prompt for ChatGPT.
                    Please do not forget that you should not copy and paste the entire article into your website as AI generated articles are classified as not to be an original and unique content for blog sites.
                    Rather you should take the article as reference to the necessary information and write your own blog posts in order to give value to your blog readers.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="h5">
                -	Ask ChatGPT to write summaries for you. If you have a big article to read and understand the important points of the article, you can send it to ChatGPT to be summarized and read the summary in order to save time for other tasks.
                    There is no character limit about how big your article must be. If the generated summary is long for you and you think that it will be time consuming for you to read it, just ask ChatGPT to write the summary of the summarized text.
                    Repeat it until you get the ideal number of words you would like to read.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="h5">
                -	Use ChatGPT for language translations for your projects. It is a powerful translator tool you would need for your daily tasks.
                    Just type the text to be translated to a specific language with a prompt for ChatGPT stating to translate it. Depending on the length of the text, it will be ready in approximately a minute.
