            <p class="h5">
                Dropshipping is an online sales strategy in which you buy the product from your supplier and send it to your customer who bought the product from you.

            <h2 class="text-primary">How does dropshipping work?</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                In dropshipping, you start your journey by making a research about the products on the internet. You should make your research very carefully because the products you choose to sell as a dropshipper have a big impact on your success rate.
                After creating the list of your preferred products and services, you will have to develop an e-commerce website in order to sell your products through your website.
                It is the best to use the services of e-commerce platforms if you are not familiar with web development.
                Now it is time to create listings on your website for every and each of your products. Obtain a couple of product images and the product description from the website of the product supplier.
                When you put a price on your listing, do not forget to increase the original price at least by 10% in order to make a profit out of your sales.
                In the next stage, you will have to promote your products and try to increase your monthly sales figures. When you make a sales and the payment for that sales is cleared, you are required to go to the website of the product supplier and order the product by putting the address information of the buyer as a delivery address.
                You should always take into account the delivery time for a specific product and choose a delivery time for your listing which is enough to accommodate the delivery time provided by the supplier. It is a good practice to allow at least 1 to 2 days just in case if there is a problem from the supplier side.
                In this modern age, there are many technology solutions to automate all above dropshipping processes and procedures so as to make it easier for dropshippers to manage the whole process. You can easily make online research and integrate one of the PAAS services offered by many service providers in order to automate your day to day dropshipping operations.

            <h2 class="text-primary">How you get paid in a dropshipping business?</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                It is very clear that how you get paid in this kind of business. You receive the payments, you are the king! Another advantage of a dropshipping business is that you receive the payment for a product upfront into your bank account, so you manage the cash.
                You just need to be careful about buying the product which is sold by your website from the supplier. Since you manage the money, you are directly responsible for cash flow and financial issues during the operation of a dropshipping business.

            <h2 class="text-primary">Downsides of a dropshipping business.</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                The number one downside of a dropshipping business is that you usually make very small amounts from individual sales, varies between five dollars up to fifteen dollars on average.
                As we mentioned before, even if you sell very expensive affiliate products, the commission percentages you receive from those expensive products will be lower compared to your average commission rate.
                So, at the end you end up making more or less the same amount for the products sold on your website. But if you could generate a growing number of sales, you would easily overcome this issue.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="h5">
                Another issue you can face during the operation of your dropshipping business is shipping problems which can be a big struggle for you. You should be very careful when choosing your shipping partner when you order the item from the supplierâ€™s website.
                In some cases, the transportation time takes very long, or the shipping company experience delays due to different situations which can be weather conditions or any other global or local service interruptions.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="h5">
                The other challenge you will experience when running this kind of business is bad reviews from your customers. This situation is inevitable if you have hundreds of items listed on your website and you have a very large customer base.
                As it is the case for many other type of businesses, customer service and support is the key for a successful outcome also in a drop shipping business. You should be very patient with your clients and solve their problems in every chance you have.
                But do not forget that bad reviews are not the end of everything. Previous experiences show that the clients who left a bad review for your product come back and change their reviews to a positive one when they are listened and treated well.
