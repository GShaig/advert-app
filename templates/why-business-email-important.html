              <h2 class="text-primary">What is a Business Email and why it is important?</h2>
              <p class="h5">Business email is a custom email address without generic <i>hotmail.com</i>, <i>gmail.com</i>, <i>yahoo.com</i>, or <i>mail.ru</i> extensions. Business emails are usually created under your business name or domain name like <b>name@example.com</b>.</p>
              <p class="h5">It is very important to have a business email in order to look professional and serious on the web. One option to have a custom email address is to buy a custom domain name and create email accounts under that domain name. But in this option, the number of accounts you can create or the size of a single mailbox is limited.</p>
              <p class="h5">Another way to have a business name is to buy it from a service provider like <a class="text-decoration-none" href="https://namecheap.pxf.io/2rZ2gG">Namecheap</a>, Microsoft Outlook 365, Google Workspace etc. Our Business Email Advisor tool gets the necessary information from you and advises you the best and the most cost-effective business email package for you.</p>

              <p class="h5">Business email is not used just for reputation. Using custom email addresses provides better authentication and prevents your emails end up in the spam or junk folder. Additionally, some service providers for your business may require you to have a business email before you can create your account or register for the service.</p>
              <p class="h5">In terms of business and communications, custom email addresses will help you a lot. It is good for both internal and external communications in your organization.

Security is also important in order to protect any confidential information in your emails and prevent you from cyber attacks as your username and password can be stolen.</p>
