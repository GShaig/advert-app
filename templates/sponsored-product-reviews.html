            <p class="h5">
                Lets first start with the definition of a sponsored product review. One of the most important success factors for online sellers is product reviews.
                Potential clients always check your product reviews on different review sites such as <b>trustpilot.com</b>, <b>trustradius.com</b>, and <b>capterra.com</b> before they proceed to buy the product.
                In other words, product reviews is not only vital for online sellers, but also big brands selling their products offline at their stores are required to maintain a good percentage of positive feedback about their products.
                This situation is another opportunity for you to monetize your website and get the most benefit out of it. However, doing this is not an easy job and requires you to work hard to increase your website popularity.

            <h2 class="text-primary">How does sponsored product review method work?</h2>
            <p class="h5">
              In this monetization method, you usually reach the clients and different companies and offer them your services as a sponsored content marketer.
              The key point in doing sponsored product reviews is to improve your website reputation and popularity in order to leave a positive first impression in your potential customers when they visit your website the first time.
              Product owners and suppliers will not prefer to work with you if your website does not have a high SEO ranking or does not maintain a good amount of monthly organic traffic.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="h5">
              After reaching out your potential clients, they will examine your offer and inspect your website in order to make the decision to work with you or not.
              After they agree with your terms, a small contract will be signed between you and the company you work for.
              Then you will need to get familiar with their products and services so that you can write effective and helpful reviews about them.
              Some product reviewers even buy and use the product for a while in order for avoiding writing a misleading comment or review about the product.
              The review you write for a specific product should not necessarily be a positive review. It should be helpful and based on a real experience rather than being a positive review.
              Because if you give positive feedback to every product you review on your website, your website will no longer deemed as a trusted source of information and you will lose your users eventually.
              This situation will kill your reputation and will make it hard for you to find new clients in the future.

            <br/>
            <p class="h5">
              After you write the relevant product review and publish it on your website, you will get paid by your client.
              The best part of this kind of business structure is that you are getting paid by directly your client and you do not have to deal with different payment issues you would face when you run a drop shipping or an affiliate marketing business.
              Another advantage is that in this monetization method you will not need an e-commerce website. A basic and informative website would be enough for this task. So, your web hosting expenses will not go sky high.
              The other positive side of this business is that you can run product reviews section as part of your general purpose website.

            <h2 class="text-primary">Mistakes you can make when monetizing your website with sponsored product reviews.</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                The first thing you should be careful about in this monetization method is your client companies. Always make research about the client company beforehand in order to be on the safe side.
                Pay attention to the client for being a reputed company and confirm that by using online search engines and by checking complaint websites.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="h5">
                Always try to write an honest review about the product and try to get one before you write a review about it.
                The mistake most product reviewers do is writing a positive review about the product without having even a basic knowledge about it.
                Remember, even though it is easy to write a couple of paragraphs about a specific product, you should be careful because you are doing this as a business.
                You should always take into account customer service in your articles and try your best to give a quality review for every product you write about in order to maintain a high level of user satisfaction.
