            <h2 class="text-primary">Top eight tips about buying the most featured business email plan for your budget.</h2>
            <p class="h5">1. The most important feature for a business email plan is the mailbox size. Analyze your email traffic and choose the best size for you.</p>
            <p class="h5">2. Spams are very annoying especially if there are links or attachments in them. Try to choose a business email plan with spam filtering feature.</p>
            <p class="h5">3. In some cases, small service interruptions can lead to lost of your entire mailbox. So, having an email backup system in place is life-saving in those cases.</p>
            <p class="h5">4. You need to be sure that someone can not steal your emails and reveal confidential information about you or your clients. Getting email encryption feature is essential in these terms.</p>
            <p class="h5">5. You know a popular brand name means trust in these days. So, try to stick to the reputable email hosting providers only.</p>
            <p class="h5">6. The business email plan you choose should be a cost-effective choice as well. Check the pricing for alternative service providers and determine your business email plan within your budget.</p>
            <p class="h5">7. For the best and safest mailing experience, try to buy an SSL certificate for your domain name. SSL adds an extra layer of encryption on top of the security measures from your email hosting provider and thus provides more security for your confidential information when transmitted to and from your mailbox.</p>
            <p class="h5">8. You can also consider partnering with a third party email encryption and digital signature provider company. This will increase your chances to directly hit the inbox of your potential clients instead of end up in the spam folder. Just do not forget to put necessary keywords such as <b>important</b> or <b>urgent</b> on the subject line of your emails.</p>
