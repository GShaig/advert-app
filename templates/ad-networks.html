            <p class="h5">
                Ad network is a platform between advertisers and publishers. Publishers are people who own a website and wish to monetize their websites by selling ad spaces from the website.
                Advertisers are business owner who are looking for ad platforms to promote their businesses. The working principle of an ad network is very simple.
                It gets paid by business owners and pays the amount to its publishers by keeping a portion of the payment for itself.
                A usual ad network takes from 10% up to 15% of the payment on average. But this amount can be higher in different ad networks.

                a blog website, a free tools website or a forum website. After deciding what type of website you want to build, the next step will be choosing your niche.

            <p class="h5">
                In order to be accepted by the popular ad networks these days, there mainly four types of requirements: content requirements, traffic requirements, language requirements and navigation requirements.
                Commonly accepted content requirements include having enough content on your website, the quality and uniqueness of your content, avoiding forbidden content like pornography, discrimination, or violence, and having a set niche for your content.
                The traffic requirement is usually bound with ten thousand page views per month. Each of ad networks has its own list of supported languages.
                Your website must be in the language which is in the supported languages list of your preferred ad network. Navigation requirement means that you must have a clear and functional navigation menu on your website.

            <h2 class="text-primary">How to apply to your preferred ad network?</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                Make your research and choose the most suitable ad network for your website. Head to the website of the ad network and create an account for you. Confirm your email and phone number with the verification methods provided on the website. Then you will have to verify your ownership for the website you claim to put ads on.
                Usually this is done either by adding a CNAME record to the DNS settings of your domain name or by putting an HTML code in between the head tags on the base HTML template of your website. To verify your ownership is fairly easy compared to getting approval for ad serving from the ad network.
                After verifying your ownership, click on the "Request Review" or "Submit" button to start the evaluation process by your ad network. The platform will analyze your website and get back to you with the decision they have made for your website. This process usually takes from a couple of days up to a month.
                If your website was rejected by the ad network, there is usually a note attached to the outcome explaining the reason why your website was rejected. Do not reapply immediately after the rejection. Analyze and rectify the issue provided on the note before you apply again to get an approval from the ad network as soon as possible.
