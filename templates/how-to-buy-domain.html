            <h2 class="text-primary">Which factors are important when buying a domain name?</h2>
            <p class="h5">- <b>.com</b> extension: <b>.com</b> domain extension stays to be the most popular and reputable domain extension and surprisingly its popularity increases by years. When you buy a domain name, you should try to get <b>.com</b> extension just to be on the safe side.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Short domain: The number of characters is very important for domains. The shorter the domain, the better spelling and SEO ranking. It is very hard to remember the domains longer than 15 characters. Also keep in mind that search engines love short domains.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Important keywords: Try to get a domain with one or more popular keywords. <b>best</b>, <b>super</b>, <b>web</b>, and <b>service</b> are just some of the most searched keywords. To do this, try to use a keyword research tool like Google Keyword Planner and check monthly search volumes for your keywords.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Domain price: It is obviously one of the main factors to consider when buying a domain name. Especially if you have a limited budget, you should definitely try to get a discount or buy an expired domain.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Domain registrar: Domain registrar is very important because you will definitely need help of the customer service of your domain provider or you would need a clean and easy to use dashboard. Read reviews from different websites about the domain registrar you plan to buy a domain name from.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Expired domains: In some cases, an expired domain is a better choice. Especially if the domain had a beautiful website, a good reputation and a high traffic previously. You will also have a little saving on the price.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">Top six tips for a domain name purchase.</h2>
            <p class="h5">1. Always choose <b>.com</b> domain extension, if possible.</p>
            <p class="h5">2. Try to make your domain name as short as possible.</p>
            <p class="h5">3. Use popular keywords with high monthly search volumes like <b>online</b>, <b>real</b>, <b>world</b>, and <b>good</b> in your domain name.</p>
            <p class="h5">4. Choose one of the popular and ICANN (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) approved domain name providers.</p>
            <p class="h5">5. Average domain price is between $5 and $20, so do not pay a high price for your domain name.</p>
            <p class="h5">6. Frequently check and analyze soon to be expired domains to get a high authority domain name for a cheap price.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">Important steps for buying a domain name.</h2>
            <p class="h5">1. Determine your preferred domain name. Take into account the tips shared in the above section.</p>
            <p class="h5">2. Choose your domain registrar. Compare the registration conditions, included services and the price range from as many domain registrars as you can find on the internet.</p>
            <p class="h5">3. Head to the domain registrar's website and perform a domain search for your preferred domain name. Click on <b>Buy Now</b> or <b>Add to Cart</b> button whichever exist on the webpage. Either one of them will be shown after you make a domain name search.</p>
            <p class="h5">4. Choose your preferred time period for your domain registration. Normally, domain registrars offer from one year up to five years for registration duration.</p>
            <p class="h5">5. Fill out the full name, contact details and address information sections on the domain registration form. Be careful about your contact and address information because they will be stored on ICANN domain registration system and may be required in the future for your domain ownership confirmation.</p>
            <p class="h5">6. Select your preferred payment method and make your payment.</p>
            <p class="h5">7. After you buy your domain name, you will receive a confirmation email from the domain registrar. If you do not get your confirmation email within 24 hours, please contact the domain registrar to report the situation.</p>
            <p class="h5">8. Usually there is a link in your confirmation email which directs you to the dashboard of your domain registrar website. From that dashboard, you can manage your domain names and update your domain DNS records.</p>
            <p class="h5">9. If you do not get a link to your dashboard in the confirmation email, you will have to head to the domain registrar's website and login with your credentials you created when you bought your domain name.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">Can we get a free domain name?</h2>
            <p class="h5">The short answer is <b>Yes</b>. You can get a free domain from blog sites like <b>wordpress.org</b>, <b>blogspot.com</b>, or <b>blogger.com</b>. But the domain you get from those websites will most likely be a subdomain rather than a separate domain name.</p>
            <p class="h5">For instance, you can get <i>yourname.blogspot.com</i>, <i>name-surname.blogger.com</i>, or <i>yoursite.wordpress.org</i>. But these kinds of domains have limited abilities when it comes to SEO ranking, user experience, and business reputation.</p>
            <p class="h5">Another option would be registering domain names by using websites such as <b>freenom.com</b>, <b>dot.tk</b>, or <b>getfreedomain.name</b>. Through these websites, you can buy domain names with <i>.tk</i>, <i>.ml</i>, <i>.ga</i>, <i>.cf</i> and <i>.gq</i> domain extensions free of charge. Again, the domain names with those extensions will kill your reputation if brand awareness is very important for your business.</p>
            <p class="h5">The best way to register a free domain name is to get a domain with a hosting plan or website builder. Almost all the popular hosting providers like <b>GoDaddy</b>, <b>Ionos</b>, or <a href="https://namecheap.pxf.io/2rZ2gG" class="text-decoration-none text-primary fw-bold" target="_blank">Namecheap</a> provide a free domain name with their hosting plans or website builder services.</p>
            <p class="h5">Please note that these free domains are usually provided for one year only and the next year will be renewed at a regular rate which is normally around $15 per year.</p>
