            <h2 class="text-primary">What is an IP address and Reverse IP Lookup?</h2>
            <p class="h5">An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a network address for your computer or for the server where your website is hosted in. It is like a domain name address but with a little difference.</p>
            <p class="h5">IP addresses can change or can be reassigned in some time. IP addresses are like identity cards for technological communications between computers. The basic format for IPv4 IP addresses is like <i>123.234.123.012</i>.</p>
            <p class="h5">When you check one IP address information, you actually check the information about the computer or the server the IP address attached to. You can also see the information about the organization who owns that computer or server.</p>
            <p class="h5">Typically for IPv4 addresses, <i>127.0.0.1</i> represents local host and <i>0.0.0.0</i> represents all the IP addresses. You can learn your IP address by clicking on <b>My IP Address</b> button which located on top right corner of this website.</p>
            <p class="h5">IPv6 IP addresses are much longer than IPv4 ones and they are typically combination of numbers and letters. The format for an IPv6 type IP address is like <i> 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:1a2b:3456:7890</i>. An IPv6 address is represented with a 128 bits value. That is why IPv6 has a wider address coverage than IPv4 which uses 32-bit values to represent IP addresses.</p>
            <p class="h5">You should be aware of that the provided IP addresses may not be accurate since internet users can use a VPN (Virtual Private Network) or a reverse proxy server that can change their IP addresses to show a totally different location. This is usually done to bypass some website and service blocking in certain countries.</p>
            <p class="h5">Please note that the Reverse IP Lookup tool on this website is not a DNS Lookup and does not show the DNS records associated with a specific domain.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">What is a port number?</h2>
            <p class="h5">If an IP address was a street address, the port number could be a unit number. There is a colon ('<b>:</b>') mark between the IP address and the port number.</p>
            <p class="h5">For example, to show the port 5000 on local host, we write <i>127.0.0.1:5000</i>. Port numbers are used to run multiple servers on the same host machine.</p>
            <p class="h5">For instance, you can run one application on port number 3000 and the other application on port number 5000 on your local computer. If you wish to communicate with the application running on port 3000, just put <i>127.0.0.1:3000</i> on your browser address bar.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">Can your IP address change over time?</h2>
            <p class="h5">Simple answer to this question is <b>YES</b>. Your IP address can change over time. But this depends on many factors.</p>
            <p class="h5">Firstly, it depends on your internet service provider. Your ISP can assign a static IP address to your modem or connection. In this case, your IP address will be fixed. But most internet service providers use dynamic IP addresses for many reasons.</p>
            <p class="h5">If you have a website and you wonder if your website IP address changes over time or not, it is again depends on your domain name provider or your hosting plan provider. Hosting companies usually use two types of IP addresses: internal IP addresses and external IP addresses.</p>
            <p class="h5">Change of internal IP addresses is entirely depends on how long you use that specific service or if you refresh your resources frequently or not. Normally when you refresh a service, let it be a load balancer, a container or a database service, this process changes its IP address.</p>
            <p class="h5">But changing external IP addresses is a process most service providers do on purpose, due to security concerns. Additionally, most service providers give you a static IP address if you wish to use, such as AWS (Amazon Web Services) Elastic IP service.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">The technology behind an IP address.</h2>
            <p class="h5">IPv4 and IPv6 type IP addresses are just human readable copies of the Internet Protocol. Normally, IP addresses are in binary format in order for the internet devices to be able to communicate with each other. For example, the binary version of <i>123.234.123.234</i> is <i>01111011.11101010.01111011.11101010</i>.</p>
            <p class="h5">An IP address identifies three main parameters: the name of the host and its network interface, the location of the host, and the way how to establish a connection with the host.</p>
            <p class="h5">The need for IPv6 type IP addresses was brilliant clear when the authorities saw the drastic expansion of the Internet space back in 1995. An unprecedented increase in the number of ISPs and devices on the internet obviously created a high demand for IP addresses.  In that point, IPv6 was introduced to the Internet world. The numerical value used for an IPv6 type IP address is 128 bits value and obviously IPv6 can accommodate far a greater number of IP addresses than IPv4 can.</p>
            <p class="h5">All IP addresses are managed by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority. And there are five regional Internet registries which operate in five different continents (North America, South America, Eurasia, Africa, and Oceania). These RIRs manage the assignment of IP addresses to Internet service providers in those areas.</p>
