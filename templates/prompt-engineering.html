                In order to understand what <b>Prompt Engineering</b> is, we first need to know what a <b>prompt</b> is.
                Prompt is a command you send to artificial intelligence based applications which working with <b>natural language processing (NLP)</b> principle.
                For instance, we send to <b>ChatGPT</b>, OpenAI generated artificial intelligence tool, a prompt to ask it to do anything for us.
                This can be writing a blog post, explaining a specific topic, or generating a script to perform certain tasks.
                An example of a prompt would be "Write a blog article with at least 1000 words", "Explain what is Prompt Engineering", or "Develop a script for removing an image background".
                Any of these three examples is called a prompt. Based on the information we shared until now, what is Prompt Engineering then?
                Prompt Engineering is the art of developing effective prompts in order to get the most out of artificial intelligence based applications.
                Writing good prompts that targeted to obtain the required results is not an easy job.
                A prompt should neither be very general to miss the desired aspects of the topic, nor it to be too specific to prevent focusing on only one aspect of the topic.
                An ideal prompt should generate the information or data that the user is looking for by sending that prompt.

                <b>Prompt Engineering</b> is very crucial specialty when it comes to use artificial intelligence based tools effectively.
                You can reduce the workload at your company significantly by using artificial intelligence models such as ChatGPT.
                Especially modern natural language processing tools can receive prompts and perform many tasks you do on a daily basis, or can build an automation system for your routine works in order to save time for you.
                But Prompt Engineering is more than that.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="h5">
                There are no specific institutions or universities offering Prompt Engineering courses or degree.
                There might be online courses offered by a couple of websites or freelancers but you mainly learn Prompt Engineering by practising and improving yourself.
                Maybe in the future more options for Prompt Engineering courses or degree programs will be available for us.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="h5">
                As you know, machine learning and artificial intelligence architecture can improve itself based on previous data and situations.
                That is why Prompt Engineering is very important. Artificial intelligence tools like ChatGPT normally remembers previous prompts in one chat and responses your queries based on the previous conversation it had with you.
                This is very amazing, but also very much useful feature. Thus, Prompt Engineers try to give a position to the AI tool with their prompts in order to make them to respond their queries with the best of its abilities.
                For example, to get the best advice from ChatGPT about web development, they first send a prompt with a sentence like "You are a senior Web Developer with at least 10 years of experience".
                After this prompt, now you can ask ChatGPT any specific question about web development and expect a proper answer as a response from it.
                You should also use "Give real world examples", "Explain the topic for a 6 years old child", or "Explain the topic with simple terms" in order to better understand hard and complex topics.
                If for any reason ChatGPT stopped writing in the middle of a response, a Prompt Engineer would send a prompt like "Continue from bla bla bla" and ChatGPT would continue the previous answer in the next response.
                Given answers to the prompts coming after some introductory prompts will not be the same with the answers generated in response to directly asking the relevant questions.
                That is why you have to be very careful about preparing an artificial intelligence tool before asking your main question.

                •	Have limited information about the real time events happening in the world: All kinds of software need regular updates to be able to track the events and innovations happening in the world.
                    For example, ChatGPT have limited information about the world after 2021. It is one of the biggest differences between artificial intelligence bots and humans.

            <p class="h5">
                •	May generate biased information time to time: The information provided by an artificial intelligence bot can contradict with the common sense accepted by the majority of people.
                    Artificial intelligence models obviously have not got senses and feelings like humans, therefore such systems may occasionally give contradicting information without sensing the contrast on the matter.

            <p class="h5">
                •	Occasionally might create incorrect information: Even human beings can make mistakes in real world. Machines are not different. They can also provide incorrect or outdated information.
                    This is especially characteristic for the science and technology related topics because they are evolving very rapidly by time.

                •	Can produce sensitive information occasionally: Artificial intelligence tools can generate disturbing information for specific religion followers, political party members, or people with mental health issues.
                    Machines may also produce wrong advice about health, financial investment, or career planning topics.
                    All these topics are person specific and require individual suggestions rather than one fits all general advice.
