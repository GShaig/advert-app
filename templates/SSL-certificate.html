            <h2 class="text-primary">What is a Wildcard SSL Certificate?</h2>
            <p class="h5">A Wildcard SSL certificate is an SSL certificate which covers all your subdomains. What is a subdomain? Subdomain is a first part of your domain address. For example, in <i>www.example.com</i> "www" part is a subdomain.</p>
            <p class="h5">A subdomain can be different than "WWW". You can put "api", "application", "country" or "whatever" as a subdomain. Usually domain providers allow you to create a great deal of subdomains, if not unlimited.</p>
            <p class="h5">A single Wildcard SSL certificate will cover all of your subdomains. To obtain a Wildcard SSL certificate, just put '<b>*</b>' symbol as a subdomain when you buy an SSL certificate. For instance, if your domain is <i>example.com</i>, enter <i>*.example.com</i> in the domain section when you obtain an SSL certificate.</p>
            <p class="h5">Just don't forget to put also your root domain when you get your SSL certificate. Because a Wildcard SSL certificate will cover only subdomains, not the root domain. So you need to specify the root domain separately. But <i>www.example.com</i> will be covered among with the other subdomains of your domain name.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">Is there a free option for SSL Certificate?</h2>
            <p class="h5">Yes, there is a free SSL certificate provider called Let's Encrypt. You can search on Google and other popular search engines and get idea about Let's Encrypt.</p>
            <p class="h5">But there are some disadvantages of using Let's Encrypt. The first and the most important disadvantage is you can not issue Let's Encrypt SSL certificate for more than three months.</p>
            <p class="h5">You also need to install the issued SSL certificate on your server manually. Please also note that you can not issue a wildcard SSL certificate with the help of Let's Encrypt as of today.</p>
            <p class="h5">But it will not be a concern for you as long as you do not have a URL routing in place other than the <i>www</i> subdomain. Because the <i>www</i> subdomain will already be included in Let’s Encrypt SSL certificate when you obtain it.</p>
