                    You can also create new files in any of the project folders with ease. For new files, PyCharm suggests vast variety of file formats to choose from, including Python file, HTML file, C# / C++ files, SQL file, CSS file, JSON file, Perl file, XML file, YAML file etc.
            </p>
            <p class="h5">-	It is very easy to navigate between different tabs where you can open different project files and edit them at the same time. You can also open as many Python consoles and operating system terminals as you wish.</p>
            <p class="h5">-	The program automatically imports the project requirements and shows all the missing packages and dependencies to run the project successfully in a local environment.</p>
