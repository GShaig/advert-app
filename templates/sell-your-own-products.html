            <p class="h5">

But the key point in this method is that your script must be the one with a big demand on the internet or which addressing one of the common issues internet users face during their day to day web surfing.
              With other words, it either should be very useful and helpful for people, or should solve the problems people experience on the internet. For example, a URL shortener or a domain search tool both is a script. The first one helps social media users by making their sharing links short, and the second one gives the information about a domain name availability for the people who wish to buy the domain.
              To develop such a script and be successful, you should start with making online research and identify the common issues people face on the web and the opportunities where you can be helpful to people.
              You can either sell your entire script to people in order for them to host your script on their website and gain web traffic, or you can sell monthly membership for your script to people who want to access and use your online tool. Both techniques are accepted as an effective selling method.

            <p class="h5">
                If you are a teacher such as an English or a Mathematics teacher, or if you are an expert or professional at your job, for example, a senior software developer or a professional nutritionist, you can record courses in your subject, or record your advices and sell the video on your website.
                It is rather an easy way to promote your product that a software development, because explaining people what you are good at is an easy task.

            <p class="h5">
                If you are a painter or a person who can make exceptional and unique hand made products, then this option is for you. You can list your art works on your website and introduce them to the very big audience of internet users.
                Again, you should take into consideration the products which have a big demand for on the internet. In order to identify your product list, you should first get data from the most popular e-commerce websites and analyse the data you have for different products. After doing this, you can prepare a hand made version of the most demanded products on the web.
                This can be a phone case, a women bag, or a bowl with art works on it, whatever you can find in demand. But why sell your products on your website rather than list them on popular hand made product selling platforms like Amazon Handmade and Etsy? The number one reason why you would prefer selling your hand made products on your website is avoiding hefty listing fees on those selling platforms.
                On average, these kind of selling platforms get from 10 percent up to 30 percent of the price when you use their platforms to sell your hand made products. This is a big amount when taking into account that hand made products are usually expensive products and require a lot of hard work to design and prepare them.
                The other reason to avoid those kinds of platforms is that by getting all the traffic to their own website means a lot for online sellers and in this way, they get the opportunity to monetize their website by using other web monetization methods as well.
