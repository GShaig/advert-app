            <h2 class="text-primary">Why we need to check Domain Location?</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                We can check a domain location for various reasons. The reason can be finding out the website company headquarter, learning the website registered address, or checking the website hosted server locations.
                Please note that the location information associated with a domain name may not be the actual address of the company or the domain owner.
                Some companies and individuals prefer a domain registrar or hosting provider from another country on purpose, mostly countries like the United States and Europe in order to get better hosting performance and SEO ranking.
                Occasionally you can see that the city or the exact address information is not available for specific domains.
                It means that the relevant information is redacted for privacy. Some domain owners buy a domain privacy and hide their information from check results.
                Your domain or website server location is very important also for your SEO ranking. Please note that the biggest search engines like <a class="text-decoration-none fw-bold" target="_blank" href="https://google.com">Google</a>, <a class="text-decoration-none fw-bold" target="_blank" href="https://bing.com">Bing</a>, <a class="text-decoration-none fw-bold" target="_blank" href="https://yandex.ru">Yandex</a>, and <a class="text-decoration-none fw-bold" target="_blank" href="https://yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> are taking account your server location when ranking you on search results.
                Some web hosting providers allow you to choose your server location from a handful of server options. If you have that chance, it is better to choose the servers in North America or in Europe for a better website performance and SEO ranking.

            <h2 class="text-primary">Why Domain Location tool shows different address for my domain?</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                It is because some domain registrars do not register the domain directly under your address. The registrar puts its own address and contact details instead of yours.
                The reason of this procedure is the registrar wants to handle all issues and communications about that domain on behalf of you.
                If you wish to put only your name and contact information on WHOIS database, you should contact your domain registrar's support line.
                Another reason why you see a different address on your domain location lookup is because the tool shows your web server or data center location rather than showing the address of the domain owner. This is not a weird thing since your website is actually hosted in that web server.
                This can also happen as a result of your mistake or a mistake from your domain registrar side. If you have made a mistake or a typographical error when filling the domain registration form, simply contact your domain registrar to rectify the issue.
                If you believe that a mistake was done by the domain registrar, inform your domain registrar as soon as possible about the problem. Because it is illegal to give a wrong or false address information during your domain registration.

            <h2 class="text-primary">What about domain names with country code extensions?</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                Having a country code domain extension such as <b>.us</b> for the United States or <b>.co.uk</b> for the United Kingdom does not mean that domain name is hosted on the servers located in those countries.
                As you know, in these days everybody can get domain names with different country code extensions. That means you can just head in to any domain registrar website and register a domain name with almost any country code extension.
                The most important factor in domain location is where your domain registrar is located or where your domain registrar's servers located.
                If your domain registrar's headquarter is located in Europe, the domain location lookup tool will most probably show a location in Europe.

            <h2 class="text-primary">Commonly hidden information in domain location lookup results.</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                Individuals and companies mostly wish to hide their exact address or the address of their headquarter from domain location lookups.
                They do not want to disclose their open address in order to prevent unwanted visits and attacks to their premises.
                But the city, state, and country information are mostly visible on domain location lookup results. But some domain owners hide the city and state information as well.

            <h2 class="text-primary">What are the differences between IP Lookup and Domain Lookup?</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                Actually, IP Lookup is the same thing with Domain Lookup. Because there is always one IP address associated with a domain name.
                When a user enter a domain name to the address bar of a web browser, the browser sends an HTTP request to the IP address associated with the domain name.
                That means all the requests sent to a domain name resolve to the IP address connected with the domain. That is why there is no difference if you use IP Lookup or Domain Lookup to find out the information related to a specific website.
                Since IP Lookup results are usually full of technical terms, it is better for non-technical people to use Domain Lookup for their researches.
                In some hosting providers like AWS cloud hosting services, the associated IP address with your domain name changes occasionally.
                But these kinds of hosting providers usually provide a service to keep your IP address fixed, such as Elastic IP service from Amazon Web Services.
