            <p class="h5">
                Affiliate marketing is a business structure where promoters get different product links from the product suppliers and earn a portion of the payment from every sales through these links.
                These links are called affiliate links and the portion of the payment which affiliate marketers receive is called a commission.
                In order to build a successful affiliate marketing business, you will have to start your journey by making researches about the best and most paid affiliate programs on the internet.
                Your products can be physical products, as well as digital products such as software programs and e-books.
                The most popular affiliate programs on the market includes <b>Amazon Associates</b>, <b>Fiverr</b>, <b>Bluehost</b>, <b>Namecheap</b> etc.
                Besides the affiliate programs, you need to evaluate each product they offer and the prospects those products promise to you for the future of your business.

            <p class="h5">
                Even though an affiliate marketing business does not require a website to conduct day to day operations, it is a good practice to build an e-commerce website or a landing page for your affiliate products.
                You should add all the affiliate products with a couple of images and product description to your website from the website of the product supplier.
                Make your website easy to navigate for the users and the list of products should be browsable with categories and a search box.
                It would be great if you also add a comments section to each product page. In this way, your potential clients who enter your website will be able to navigate around their favorite items and search what they look for without any hassle.
                If your customers wish to buy one of your items, they will just need to click on a buy button and be directed to the original page of the item. On that page, they can easily make payment and purchase their preferred product.

            <h2 class="text-primary">Working principle of affiliate links.</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                Please note that for an affiliate marketing business, you do not need to integrate a payment processing system into your website because the payment is done on the product supplier’s website.
                When a user clicks on your affiliate link for the product he / she want to buy, the link directs him / her to the website of the product supplier.
                During this process, your affiliate account details will be saved on a cookie by the web browser of the user.
                There is a term in affiliate marketing named a cookie duration which is the limit how long your affiliate account details will be kept in the cookie.
                This means that even if the user does not buy the item from the supplier at that very moment, your chances to get your commission will still exist until the end of the cookie duration.
                In other words, if the user comes back and buys the item within the cookie duration, you will still get your commission as usual. But it is not the case if the cookie duration is expired.
                Then the user will need to click on your affiliate link again in order for you to get your commission without any issue.
                Some affiliate programs does not apply the product limitation, meaning that even if the user buys a different product from the supplier’s website other than your affiliate product, you will still get the percentage of the payment depending on the product type.
                For example, if your affiliate product is a coffee mug and a user clicks on your affiliate link and buys a TV from the supplier, you will still get your commission from the sales of the TV.
                Though the commission percentage for the TV will be different than you would get for the coffee mug, as you would expect. Normally, as the price of a product goes up, the affiliate commission percentage goes down.

            <h2 class="text-primary">How you get paid as an affiliate marketer?</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                You earn a commission for every sale you generate through your affiliate links. Your earnings will be shown on your dashboard on the website of the affiliate program.
                Usually, there is an earnings threshold for each affiliate program and the threshold amount varies based on the affiliate program you enrolled in.
                The threshold is mostly in between ten dollars and a hundred dollars. Once you reach the threshold amount, you can withdraw your earnings with one of the cash out methods your affiliate program provides.
                Most affiliate programs support <b>wire transfer</b>, <b>PayPal</b>, <b>Payoneer</b>, <b>Skrill</b> and any other online payments platform as their withdrawal methods.
