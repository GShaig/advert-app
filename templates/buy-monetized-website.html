              When buying an already monetized website, you should pay attention to your own safety. The internet is a huge and global marketplace where there are many options to buy and sell websites.
              Besides the good and genuine people who really want to make business online, there are also many scammers who are looking for every opportunity to steal your money.
              Transferring a website and sending money are the actions where both parties are very vulnerable in terms of the management of the whole process.
              In order to prevent unwanted damages during this stage, you should always prefer to make the deal through the trusted intermediary sales platforms.

            <h2 class="text-primary">How do website sales platforms work?</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                Lets give an in detail explanation about how flippa.com and similar platforms work. First you need to sign up to the platform and create an account for you.
                Then you will have to verify your payment method. After that, you finally will be able to bid your offer and buy any website on the platform securely.
                Browse the websites on the list and choose the most suitable one for your needs. Then you can place bid for your preferred website or you can buy the website right now by paying the instant purchase price.
                After you are successful in the auction you place a bid for or after your instant purchase of the website, your money will be transferred to the system and kept there until you confirm that you have got the ownership of the website.
                Meanwhile, the seller is responsible to arrange all the procedures to transfer the ownership of the website to you.
                This can happen either by giving you the login credentials to the hosting panel of the website or by following the transfer protocol of the domain name and the hosting provider.
                After getting the ownership of the website and the domain name, you are free to confirm your purchase and after that, the payment will be released by the system and the seller will receive your money in a couple of days.

            <h2 class="text-primary">Which monetization method is the best to buy with a website?</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                When you browse a list of websites on flippa.com, you can see that the monetization method for different websites varies greatly.
                Some of the websites are monetized with the combination of available monetization methods. For example, one website can be monetized with both affiliate sales and ad revenue at the same time.
                But which monetization method is the best to purchase a website with? The answer to this question depends on your situation and each of the monetization methods has its own risks to deal with.
                For example, having a thousand dollars revenue from affiliate sales per month for a specific website does not guarantee that you will receive the same sales amount each month from that website.
                The current owner of the website may follow a special sales strategy to reach that amount every single month. So, if you do not have the knowledge to implement a similar sales strategy, you may be disappointed with the result.
                Similarly, if a website gets two thousand dollars ad revenue per month, this does not mean that you will receive the same amount.
                For such situation, the website owner will probably not pass you his / her AdSense and other ad platforms accounts which means you will have to apply to the same ad platforms again by creating your own account on each ad platform.
                As a result, it is not guaranteed that your newly created account and your new website will be approved by the relevant ad platform authorities.
                But there is one thing that is guaranteed that you will receive it: the organic traffic that the website receives each month. But be careful about that.
                Check and confirm that the organic traffic information about the website is verified by flippa.com. Otherwise, you will risk your money and your efforts for a false information provided by the website owner.
                Please note that transferring an ecommerce or other kind of monetized website is a long process and requires a lot of patient from both buyer and seller.
                For this reason, you may want to develop your own website rather than buying one. Please also do not forget to check the SEO ranking, the domain age, the content management system and verify that the website ownership belongs that person via simple WHOIS lookup before proceeding to buy the website.
                It is also worth checking the production platform of the website and the programming language the website was built with. Because if you do not have knowledge of the programming language or the production environment of the website, that means you will not be able to manage and update that website yourself.
                You will need to hire developers or someone with the required knowledge to manage that website for you.
