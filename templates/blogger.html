            <h2 class="text-primary">Is there any cost associated with using Blogger?</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                 Blogger is a free and open source platform for bloggers from all over the world. You can create your website free of charge.
                There is no need to pay for the hosting provided for your website. It is like a more free and customizable version of social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram.
                There is not any limitation on how to design your website. You can add images, sliders, and carousels as you wish, or design your footer, header, and navigation menu according to your preferences.

            <h2 class="text-primary">Is a domain name included in the Blogger package?</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                If you do not have a domain name, do not worry! If you have not purchased a domain name and do not wish to do, <b>Blogger</b> will offer you a <b>Blogspot</b> domain.
                But what is a Blogspot domain name? Blogspot domain is a free domain name which is created under the root <a href="https://www.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" class="text-decoration-none text-primary fw-bold">blogspot.com</a> domain.
                It is like a subdomain of <b>blogspot.com</b> domain name. You can choose your subdomain part if it is available to use.
                For example, if your name is David and the <b>david.blogspot.com</b> domain is available, you can get it.
                Or if you are planning to start a news website and <b>news.blogspot.com</b> is free to choose, that means you are on your lucky day.
                If your preferred subdomain is not available to register, you can add extra words or numbers to the next of your subdomain and check if that one is available to register.
                For instance, instead of <b>news.blogspot.com</b>, you can check if <b>todaynews.blogspot.com</b> or <b>7news.blogspot.com</b> is available to get for your blog site.
                You can also purchase a custom domain name and connect it to your Blogger website with a couple of clicks.

            <h2 class="text-primary">The most significant advantages of Blogger over other web development platforms.</h2>
            <p class="h5">-	The number one advantage of the Blogger platform is the free hosting offered by the platform for a lifetime. There is not any hidden cost regarding this service.</p>
            <p class="h5">-	The other advantage can be the easy to use user interface of the platform. Everything is visible and under your hands on the dashboard.</p>
            <p class="h5">-	Another advantage would be the easy integration with the other <b>Google</b> services such as <b>Google Analytics</b>, <b>Google Search Console</b> and <b>Google AdSense</b>.</p>
            <p class="h5">-	You do not have to deal with day to day management of your hosting server including package installations and making the necessary configurations.</p>
            <p class="h5">-	When you use Blogger, you do not have to worry about every aspect of your SEO settings. Some SEO configurations will be done automatically by Blogger.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">What are the possible disadvantages of the Blogger platform?</h2>
            <p class="h5">-	The limited ability of customization. As a web development platform, Blogger is only suitable for blog sites. If you wish to host online tools and many functionality on your website, Blogger is not an option for you. In such a case, you should go with WordPress or develop your own website from scratch.</p>
            <p class="h5">-	Low capacity. Blogger is suitable for a simple blog site, but it can not host a website with a heavy media or content loading. If you are planning to upload many videos to your website or wish to start a website with a lot of content related to your graphic designs, you should forget about using the Blogger platform.</p>
            <p class="h5">-	A custom domain name is not provided. Blogger does not offer a complete package for your website. If you wish to host your website on a custom and pretty domain name, you will have to buy it yourself.</p>
