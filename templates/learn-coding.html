                When it comes to from where to start your web development journey, we will introduce you the common model which accepted by the majority of senior web developers and online learning institutions.
                As you well know at this stage, there are main directions for a beginner web developer to proceed to: Frontend Development and Backend Development.
                Experts and specialists suggest that starting with the Frontend development is much easier and better for prospective job opportunities for new learners compared to the Backend web development.
                Thus, we will start with explaining what the Frontend web development is and how to learn it effectively.

            <h2 class="text-primary">What are Frontend and Backend web developments?</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                When you enter a website address in the search bar of your web browser, you will see the front page of the website with a lot of content, images, and a navigation menu on the computer screen.
                In web development terminology, we call this part of the website as <b>Frontend</b>. Because this is the front side of a website and controls the direct interaction between a website and a user.
                Frontend development includes many factors such as user interface, user experience, event listeners, and website design.
            </p>
            <br/>
            <p class="h5">
                Backend development, on the other hand, consists of the operations conducted on behind of the website user interface.
                These operations can include database management, data processing, some calculations, storage management and all kinds of heavy jobs that can not be done on the frontend.
                You can design the backend of your website as you wish, from simple API development to more complex microservices architecture, or you can use one of the web frameworks to make it simple for you to develop your backend.
                There are many options mentioned on the internet for backend technologies and solutions associated with different programming languages.

            <p class="h5">
                If you have decided to start with Frontend development as it is a commonly accepted way to start a career for novice developers, lets go step by step from simple to very complex topics.
                As a normal and easiest starting point, you should start learning with <b>HTML markup</b> language and template development.
                HTML is like a skeleton for a website and a very basic structure to learn in order to enter the world of web development.
                You will use different tags such ad <b>html</b>, <b>head</b>, <b>body</b>, and <b>footer</b> and enter the necessary information between them when learning HTML markup language.
                Then it becomes a little bit harder when you start learning more difficult topics such as template inheritance, if blocks, and meta tags.
                The next step would be learning <b>CSS</b> which is a styling language and helps us to add a little spices to our solid and standard HTML templates.
                CSS is very functional tool when it comes to prepare an attractive and eye catching web page design. You can create different kinds of animations, slides and colorful backgrounds by using CSS on your website.
                If you want to use ready classes and pre-built features of CSS rather than coding your own classes, you can use very powerful CSS framework called <b>Bootstrap</b> for your web project.
                And the final step for learning the Frontend web development is getting familiar with JavaScript, an exceptional programming language which manages all the events and functions on the front web interface.
                Learning JavaScript can be a bit complicated compared to the previous two programming languages but it definitely pays off.
                With JavaScript, you can make the frontend of your website very functional that even you can perform some backend task on your frontend.
                There are many useful JavaScript frameworks and libraries on the market for frontend design such as <b>React JS</b>, <b>Angular</b>, <b>Vue.Js</b>, <b>Next Js</b> etc.

            <h2 class="text-primary">Where to start learning the Backend technologies?</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                The answer to the above question really depends on your personality and preferences. First things first, you should choose your favorite programming language to start your backend web development career.
                There is no any known advantage of one programming language to the other, you can perform any kind of task with the help of almost all programming languages.
                The most common programming languages used for backend web development are <b>Python</b>, <b>PHP</b>, <b>Java</b>, <b>.NET</b>, and <b>Ruby</b>.
                After learning the basics of your preferred programming language, it is advised that to learn at least one of the web frameworks built on that programming language, like <b>Django</b> for Python, <b>Laravel</b> for PHP, or <b>Ruby on Rails</b> for Ruby, in order to simplify your way to build a productive backend solution.
                Database management is also included in the backend web development. There are mainly two types of databases exist: SQL relational databases and NoSQL non-relational databases.
                <b>SQLite</b>, <b>MySQL</b>, <b>PostgreSQL</b>, and <b>Microsoft SQL Server</b> are among the relational databases. Non-relational databases are also called document based databases because their data storage structure is document based and works with the data in JSON format.
                The most popular non-relational databases examples include <b>MongoDB</b>, <b>DynamoDB</b>, <b>Redis</b>, and <b>Apache Cassandra</b>. Your backend technology also manages your web server.
                If you need a basic static website, you may not need to worry about the backend management of your website.
                If you wish to start a blog website, it is a better option to work with one of the free website builders on the web rather than dealing with all the hassle involved in website development.
