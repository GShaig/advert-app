            <p class="h5">Security, of course, is the number one concern when it comes to e-commerce websites. You are responsible for the safety of your clients and also for your own security.

            <p class="h5">First things first, you should install an SSL certificate on your web server in order to encrypt all available data and protect the identity and information of your clients. The next step is implementing security measures like securing your database, applying two factor authentication for user logins, and provide 3-D Secure protocol for payment processing.</p>
            <br/>
            <p class="h5">Issues with the payment processing system comes second as it can also lead to devastating losses. If your payment processing system is not consistent and reliable, you and your customer may be subject to great losses, not to mention the loss of all your savings.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">Best practices to implement for your e-commerce business.</h2>
            <p class="h5">Always take care of your clients. Customer service is one of the most important factors for your success as an e-commerce website owner. Identify all the bad reviews given by your customers and answer each and every of them by providing the necessary information or assistance to solve the problem all at once.</p>
            <p class="h5">Remember, there is no a bad review without a bad experience behind it. Try to find out the source issue and resolve it as soon as possible. In most situations, the problems many of your clients are complaining about are coming from the same origin and there is only one issue causing all these headaches. If this is the case, you can release all the stress by simply solving the source problem.</p>
            <br/>
            <p class="h5">Choose your delivery partner carefully. Your delivery partner must be reliable and efficient in order for you to better serve your customers. Big delays in delivery can make your impatient clients angry and kill your reputation as a seller which result in losing your clients in a long term.</p>
            <p class="h5">So, you will have to organize and effectively monitor the transportation of the goods and services you sell on your website. Even though many shipping problems originate from your delivery partner, the clients who have bad experiences will always remember your brand name as the source of the problems and  eventually will stop coming back to your website.</p>
            <p class="h5">Do not forget that your potential clients always make their research and read the reviews about your e-commerce website on different user experience websites before coming to your website and buying your products.</p>
