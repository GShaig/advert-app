            <h2 class="text-primary">Why is a custom domain name important?</h2>
            <p class="h5">Having a custom domain name shows your professionalism and creates very positive experience for your website visitors.</p>
            <p class="h5">If your company is an existing business and operates in one or multiple industries, a custom domain name will make your brand more visible and easily discovered by your potential clients.</p>
            <p class="h5">It also gives you credibility in the eye of the most popular search engines like <a class="text-decoration-none fw-bold" target="_blank" href="https://google.com">Google</a>, <a class="text-decoration-none fw-bold" target="_blank" href="https://bing.com">Bing</a>, <a class="text-decoration-none fw-bold" target="_blank" href="https://yandex.ru">Yandex</a>, and <a class="text-decoration-none fw-bold" target="_blank" href="https://yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>.</p>
            <p class="h5">If you think about monetizing your website and apply for different ad platforms such as Google AdSense, Amazon Ads or PropellerAds, a custom domain name will be a great advantage for getting fast approvals.</p>
            <p class="h5">A custom domain name is as cheap as $5 these days and if you wish to buy a web hosting package also, a domain name mostly will be included in the package.</p>
            <p class="h5">Usually, .com domains are a bit expensive than the domain names with other domain extensions. Because <b>com</b> was the first domain extension in the history and it is still the most widespread one.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">What is a TLD?</h2>
            <p class="h5">TLD (top-level domain) is also called as domain extension. It is the last part of a domain name. For example, for <i>www.example.com</i> the TLD is ".com" part.</p>
            <p class="h5">There are three main types of TLDs:</p>
            <p class="h5">- <b>gTLD</b> (Generic top-level domain): This category includes the most popular TLDs like .com, .org, and .net</p>
            <p class="h5">- <b>ccTLD</b> (Country code top-level domain): These TLDs are country codes belong to different countries such as .us for the United States or .de for Germany.</p>
            <p class="h5">- <b>nTLD</b> (New top-level domain): The last category includes the modern TLDs which were introduced to the market in the recent years like .online or .city</p>
            <p class="h5">There is also the <b>.gov</b> domain extension which is specific to governmental departments. Normal <b>.gov</b> extension is for governmental departments in United States and <b>.gov</b><i>.countrycode</i> is specific to the relevant country governments.</p>
            <p class="h5">The most popular TLDs are <b>.com</b>, <b>.org</b>, <b>.net</b>, <b>.info</b>, <b>.mobi</b>, <b>.me</b>, <b>.biz</b>, <b>.app</b>, <b>.co</b>, <b>.cc</b>, <b>.online</b> etc.</p>
            <p class="h5">Our website offers most of the popular TLDs and all the major country domain extensions.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">What is a subdomain?</h2>
            <p class="h5">A subdomain is the first part of a domain address. For example, in <i>www.example.com</i> the subdomain is "www." part. A generic subdomain <b>www</b> means World Wide Web.</p>
            <p class="h5">A subdomain can be different than <i>www.</i>. We can set any name as a subdomain to our domain name. In some cases, subdomains represent different servers on the same domain name.</p>
            <p class="h5">Different subdomains can also show the different parts of a website. Additionally, they can be assigned to different applications within the same website.</p>
            <p class="h5">When obtaining an SSL certificate, you should include all of your subdomains or you should get a wildcard SSL certificate. Wildcard SSL certificate covers all of your subdomains. You can obtain a wildcard SSL certificate by putting '*' as a subdomain when you enter your domain name to the relevant section. Like <i>*.example.com</i>.</p>
            <p class="h5">You can structure the different sections, pages, blog posts, or multiple languages on your website either with the help of subdomains or simply by using permalinks.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">What if the domain name you are looking for is already registered?</h2>
            <p class="h5">If the domain name you are looking to buy is already registered, you can find out the domain owner and contact details by simply clicking on the red <span class="text-danger fw-bold">WHOIS</span> button next to the domain name.</p>
            <p class="h5">Some domain registrar companies provide a brokerage service for negotiation between their clients and domain owners. They usually charge a small fee for this service. You can either use a broker service or simply contact the domain owner and try to negotiate with him / her.</p>
            <p class="h5">If the expiration date of the domain name is within a couple of weeks, it is a good idea to wait until the domain expiration and register the domain with your own service provider.</p>
            <p class="h5">Some websites provide a list of domain names soon to be expired in order to help people to register their preferred domain names. You can check on the search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Yandex to find out the best websites provide up-to-date lists.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">Advantages of buying expired domain names.</h2>
            <p class="h5">The first advantage of buying expired domain names is they are usually cheaper than brand new ones. Some domain registrars charges as low as $1 for an expired domain name.</p>
            <p class="h5">Another advantage is an expired domain name usually has a better SEO ranking because the previous owner may already introduce the domain name to the most popular search engines.</p>
            <p class="h5">Moreover, even though the domain name is not active right now, there are probably a ton of backlinks directing traffic to the domain. Expired domain name has usually higher domain authority compare to brand new domains.</p>
            <p class="h5">Lastly, having all the traffic the previous website was getting is also a grate advantage. Even you can continue the previous niche and the services of the old website, if you have enough knowledge and expertise about the topic.</p>
