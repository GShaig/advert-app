            <p class="h5">
                Drop servicing is like dropshipping. But in drop servicing, you deal with digital services rather than physical products.
                The product can be an online course, an online service membership, or any other kind of online services. You can drop service professional services as well such as web development or graphic design.
                To establish a drop servicing business, you will need to have an e-commerce website. It is because you will sell the services you provide through your website and accept payments for them.
                To be successful in drop servicing, you should be familiar with digital marketing and online sales strategies.

            <h2 class="text-primary">How does drop servicing work?</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                Drop servicing simply means that you buy some services provided on the Internet and sell them at a higher price. But this process is not that simple.
                You first need to make deep research on the internet and identify the potential services you can sell as a part of your drop servicing business.
                This can be a web development course, a video streaming website membership or any other kind of services you can find on freelancing websites like <b>Freelancer</b>, <b>Fiverr</b>, <b>UpWork</b>, <b>Toptal</b> etc.
                In example, you can also sell professional services such as digital marketing services or logo design services provided on freelancer gigs from different websites.
                The key point in this kind of business structure is to increase the price of a service you sell at least by 10 to 15 percents.
                Actually, the increase in the service price depends on what kind of service you sell or if the service is expensive or cheap.
                If you sell services with the price well above a thousand dollar, five percent increase in the price will be more than enough for a regular income from your drop servicing business.
                The second milestone in drop servicing business is to build an e-commerce website where you can sell your services and accept payments for them.
                It is not an easy job especially if you do not posses web development skills. But thankfully, there are many platforms provide easy to use website builders to create a functional e-commerce website if you are a non-technical person.

            <h2 class="text-primary">Important points when building a drop servicing business.</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                Establishing a payment processing system is very important as you should be able to accept payments as a form of credit/debit card payment or any other kind of online payment structure.
                Most of the website builder providers include this service in their plans. But if you need to build the system yourself, it is advised to get a service from one of the reputable service providers such as <b>WooCommerce</b>, <b>PayPal</b>, or <b>Stripe</b>.
                After building your e-commerce website, you need to list all your services you plan to sell as part of your drop servicing business on your website. Include as many payment options as you can in order to broaden your customer base.
                Upload relevant and colorful pictures and write an understandable and clear product description for each of the services you provide. Make your website easy to navigate for your users and include comment sections for your products in order to appear as a genuine and trustworthy online store to your potential clients.
                The last step is promoting your drop servicing business. You can promote one of your services at a time or the whole website as you wish.
                You can create social media pages for your business on social media platforms like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram etc. You can engage in the forums such as Medium, Reddit, or Quora to drive traffic into your website from those forums.
                It is also advised to create paid advertisement and marketing campaigns for your business. It is particularly effective for drop servicing businesses to create a native ads campaign or a search engine ads campaign on different online advertising platforms like <b>Google Ads</b>, <b>Facebook Ads</b>, <b>LinkedIn Ads</b> etc.
                You should not forget also about the on page and off page SEO setups for your website. On page SEO includes writing good titles and descriptions for your pages, creating short and descriptive permalinks and URLs for your website, adding meta tags for each page, optimizing the images on your pages, and adding relevant internal and external links to your posted articles.
                Off page SEO can include link building to get valuable backlinks and 404 error evaluation to identify and eliminate your broken links.

            <h2 class="text-primary">Common Issues you can face when running a drop servicing business.</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                The number one problem you can face during the operation of your own drop servicing business is managing the supplier along the delivery of your service.
                The supplier may be incompetent of providing the relevant services or the deadline may be missed due to very slow working abilities from the supplier.
                You have to be careful when choosing your suppliers in order to better serve your clients and get grate feedback from the buyers each time you sell a service.
                Building a good reputation is very important in this kind of business structure to get a long-term success.
                Another issue can be payment issues during your sales activities. This can include technical problems during the payment or simply the client does not want to pay the payment according to agreed payment terms.
                Try to integrate the payment methods which require the clearance of the payment during the purchase session and avoid wire transfer or electronic bank cheque payments if you can.
