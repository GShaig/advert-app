            <h2 class="text-primary">What are the advantages and limits of using a VPN service?</h2>
            <p class="h5">- Reaching the blocked content for your country: We know certain websites are blocked in some countries and some popular platforms do not provide services to some countries. In order to get the content and services blocked in your country, you need to use a virtual private network (VPN) services. These limits and blocks usually associated with low-democracy and developing countries.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Changing your IP address: VPN service changes your location and IP address to one of the most developed countries where the service provider owns or hires its servers. That is why you can reach the blocked content or service easily with a VPN service. Some providers allow you to choose your virtual country from set of developed countries each time you connect to the internet.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Proxy server: Proxy server is an intermediate server between your devices and the internet. It masks your IP address and shows a different IP address by changing the IP address your internet service provider assigns to you.</p>
            <p class="h5">- VPN provider: The quality and the security level of your VPN service totally depends on your service provider. Some popular VPN service providers are <b>ExpressVPN</b>, <b>NordVPN</b>, <b>Hotspot Shield</b>, and <a href="https://namecheap.pxf.io/QOaNZo" class="text-decoration-none text-primary fw-bold" target="_blank">Namecheap</a>. You should choose your VPN provider carefully in order to get the benefits without interruption.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Price: Pricing is also important as you wish to pay less for the same benefits. Most of the VPN providers offer a free trial or monthly data limits to use free of charge. It is advised to use free trials for testing the VPN provider and make a decision if you wish to proceed to paid membership or not.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Limits: Besides its many benefits, a VPN service also comes with several limits. First of all, you need to be connected to the service in order to use it. When you accidentally disconnect from their server, your real IP address and identity will be revealed again to the internet. So, every time you connect to the internet, you need to open the application and connect to the service. Another limit is that this process usually slows down your internet connection.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">Top five situations you will experience when using a VPN service.</h2>
            <p class="h5">1. It is always annoying to be disconnected from your VPN server. Your internet connection will immediately be interrupted and if the website you connected to is banned in your country, you will see error in connection with the website.</p>
            <p class="h5">2. If you picked a server location very far from your country, your internet surfing speed will be very low. This is because of the lengthy internet communication between the website server, VPN server and your device. For this reason, always stick to the location closest to your country.</p>
            <p class="h5">3. Some email service, SAAS, PAAS or IAAS service providers recognize the situation as an account hack when you sign in to your account with virtual location. Then in most cases, you need to pass an extra security layer in order to reach your account. It can be annoying to do this each time you sign in to your accounts.</p>
            <p class="h5">4. VPN service providers mostly charge you for the service. It can be in a form of monthly or yearly memberships or one-time payment. There are free services also available but they are usually limited to up to 10 GB data transfer per month which is not enough for data-heavy activities such as video streaming or free trial for a limited time. In both cases the features will be limited compared to paid memberships.</p>
            <p class="h5">5. If you were signed in your account before using your VPN server, some service providers and websites can detect that you are on a VPN network. In this case, they will still block you from the services which are blocked in your country. To prevent this kind of issues, please sign out all of your accounts before connecting to your VPN service. Activate the VPN server and sign in to your account after that.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">Top five tips for buying a VPN service.</h2>
            <p class="h5">-	When you buy a VPN service, the first thing to check is the bandwidth limit. Find out if the provider offers unlimited bandwidth or not. You do not want to be restricted with data limits.</p>
            <p class="h5">-	Choose a VPN service provider who offers the closest data centres to your current location. Using a server very far from your location will definitely slow down your internet speed.</p>
            <p class="h5">-	Pay attention to the price. Service providers offer VPN plans with very low prices like $10 per year in these days. So, VPN services are as affordable as domain names in today's world.</p>
            <p class="h5">-	Look for a service provider with extensive customer service. Your provider should maintain 24/7 customer support level.</p>
            <p class="h5">-	Choose a virtual private network location where there is a small number of restricted websites. One of the main reasons why people use a VPN service is unblocking restricted websites.</p>
