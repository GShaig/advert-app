              <h2 class="text-primary">The most important features to consider when buying a business email service.</h2>
              <p class="h5">- Mailbox size: The mailbox size is the most important factor when deciding your business email provider. Email service providers usually offer from 100 MB to 50 GB storages for your emails. If you have high and content rich email traffic, you should definitely consider higher mailbox capacity in order to prevent email sending and receiving issues.</p>
              <p class="h5">- Spam filtering: Spam filtering is an amazing feature offered by most of the business email providers that helps you a lot. Although some free email and webmail service providers also offer spam filtering, the quality of a spam filtering service differs greatly. Excessive spam filtering is also a problem because it can mark your important emails as spam.</p>
              <p class="h5">- Backup: Backup service is crucial in order to prevent data loss when unprecedented problems occur. This is especially important if you are dealing with a large client base and you have a high number of email traffic daily. The frequency of mailbox backup can differ by different service providers. But it is usually safe to get at least monthly backups.</p>
              <p class="h5">- Encryption: End-to-end encryption is also important when it comes to handling sensitive data. If you wish to protect the data of your customers or your own organization, it is advised to check if encryption services is included in your business email plan. If not, it is better to look for other service providers.</p>
              <p class="h5">- Email server provider: The quality of your business email service also depends on your service provider. The most popular service providers are <b>Microsoft Outlook 365</b>, <b>Google Workspace</b>, <b>GoDaddy</b>, and <b>Namecheap</b>. Choosing a reputable service provider is important to get most out of your business email plan.</p>
              <p class="h5">- The plan pricing: Some service providers charge really high. Be careful about the price and make mini research on the price range before going with one service provider. Compare the popular service providers to get the most cost-effective email package.</p>

              <h2 class="text-primary">What is a mailing list and email marketing?</h2>
              <p class="h5">A mailing list is a list of names and corresponding email addresses usually used by businesses to contact with their potential clients. Building a mailing list is not an easy job and requires months to collect email addresses from people who interested in your products or services. Companies usually do this with the help of contact forms and newsletter subscriptions on their websites.</p>
              <p class="h5">After building your mailing list, comes the second stage which is email marketing. You keep your potential customers updated with frequent marketing emails. You should also carefully monitor your email marketing campaign due to identify the success rate of the campaign.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">Necessary steps to go through when purchasing your business email plan.</h2>
            <p class="h5">1. Determine how many email accounts you need and the size of each mailbox. If you have difficulties in making decisions for your business email plan, check our best tips and tricks shared above.</p>
            <p class="h5">2. Then you need to choose your business email provider. Compare the pricing and offered features in different business email plans offered with different service providers. Gather information about as many service providers as you can find on the internet. It will increase your chances to get the most suited business email plan for you.</p>
            <p class="h5">3. Head to the website of the business email hosting provider and choose your preferred business email plan. Enter the number of business email accounts you would need. You will see either a <b>BUY</b> or <b>Add to Cart</b> button. Check the total price shown on the screen and if it is okay for you, press the button to buy the plan.</p>
            <p class="h5">4. Email business plans are usually to be registered for a year. We do not recommend buying an email account for more than one year because you can already extend your subscription at the end of the year or you can get the backup of your mailboxes and switch to another business email service provider.</p>
            <p class="h5">5. Choose your preferred payment method to pay for your business email plan. The payment normally is a form of monthly subscription. Offered payment methods usually include debit or credit card payment and Paypal.</p>
            <p class="h5">6. After that, you will get a confirmation email in most cases. If it is not arrived within 24 hours, it is advised that you contact to the service provider.</p>
            <p class="h5">7. Then head to your management dashboard on the service provider's website either by clicking on the activation link provided in your confirmation email or providing your login credentials and sign in into the member panel.</p>
            <p class="h5">8. Usually on your dashboard you will see a tutorial explaining you how to create your email accounts. Create as many email accounts as you need which limited with the number of email accounts you bought from the service provider.</p>
            <p class="h5">9. Do not forget to test your email accounts by sending emails to your external email accounts (gmail, hotmail, outlook, yandex mail etc.) or between your internal email accounts. Check if the emails sent from your business email accounts end up in the spam or junk folder or the emails are marked as coming from an unknown source.</p>
