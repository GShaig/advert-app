            <h2 class="text-primary">Why choosing your server location is important for your website performance?</h2>
            <p class="h5">- SEO ranking: Server location is important for your SEO ranking. <b>Google</b>, <b>Bing</b>, <b>Yandex</b>, and other search engines prioritize the websites hosted in certain locations. These locations are North America, Europe and Australia. If you have a server in one of these locations, you will get higher ranking from search engines.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Website performance: Most of the website owners target the audience living in North America, Europe or Australia. If your target audience is in one these locations, your web server also should be located as close to those countries as possible. If your target audience live in the United States, it is better to have a web server in the United States in order to achieve low loading times and better response times for your users.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Content Delivery Network (CDN): Content delivery network is a network of web servers where one particular hosting company owns servers in different countries and locations. For example, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google have servers all over the world. In this way, they can host your website files in the servers located in different locations. If you wish to target North America and Europe, you can hire servers in those locations. So when a user enters to your website, it will load the files from the nearest server to the user.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Which locations to choose: Since most of the website owners choose their target audience as one of the countries in North America, Europe or Australia, it is a good idea to choose a web server located one of those countries. As a result, you can offer your target audience fast rendering and improved backend response.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">What is a domain registrar, a name server, a content delivery network, and a hosting provider?</h2>
            <p class="h5">
                A domain registrar is a company who helps people to register their domain names through ICANN. A hosting provider is a company which supplies web spaces to people who want to run their web applications online.
                If your domain registrar and hosting provider are different companies, you need to direct your domain name to your hosting web space by putting the name server records of your hosting provider into your name servers settings on the website of your domain registrar.
                In this way, all the requests sent to your domain name will be resolved to the IP address of your web server.
                A content delivery network is a network of web servers and data centres spread all over the world. With the help of a CDN, you can store the static files of your website on the web servers located in all the continents in the world.
                When a user from a very far location enters your website, the static files of your website will be rendered from the closest web server which holds all the files for you.
                Usually, this network and different connection layers are structured as below. All requests made to your domain name go through this: A domain name + A content delivery network + A load balancer + A hosting web space (where your website is hosted).

            <h2 class="text-primary">Top six interesting facts about servers that everyone who owns a website should know.</h2>
            <p class="h5">1. Servers are like personal computers. You can install any operating system on your server. Hosting providers usually offer web servers with pre-installed operating systems.</p>
            <p class="h5">2. Some web hosting companies provide a file system to manage your web server. But those file systems are usually very slow when it comes to uploading files to the web server. Therefore, the best option to connect to your web server is through SSH connection (shell access) by providing your username and password. Another option is to use an FTP client like FileZilla, Cyberduck or PuTTY to connect to your server.</p>
            <p class="h5">3. Servers are devices located in the infrastructures usually owned by big telecom and software companies such as <b>Amazon Web Services</b>, <b>Microsoft</b>, <b>Google</b>, and <b>Meta</b> (Facebook). They own the servers in all around the world and rent them to their customers.</p>
            <p class="h5">4. You can install different software and packages to your web server. You should design and manage your server carefully in order to increase your website performance and security. To achieve high processing speed and better performance in your server, try to avoid installing heavy or faulty software in your server.</p>
            <p class="h5">5. There is a couple of options how to host your application on a web server. You can write codes and scripts in your project files and deploy your application to your server or you can write your codes directly to the files in the servers. Another option is to install a content management system in your server and then create your web pages easily with the help of the CMS. In all cases, you need to install and configure a web server software like Apache or Nginx in order to run your codes and scripts smoothly.</p>
            <p class="h5">6. Some web hosting providers offer an environment in their shared servers where you can develop your own web application in different programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, C#, .NET, Java etc. These environments are configured for a specific programming language and all dependencies of that language are installed in advance. This provides a cheap alternative to VPS hosting for website developers.</p>
