            <h2 class="text-primary">Top eight tips about getting the best hosting you can buy.</h2>
            <p class="h5">1. Analyze the hosting types and get the most suitable hosting for you. Do not spend more money on VPS or dedicated server hosting if a shared hosting plan is enough for you.</p>
            <p class="h5">2. If you use a content management system, choose the hosting plan based on your CMS. For example, if you plan to use WordPress content management system to build and develop your site, get a WordPress hosting plan. Almost all web hosting providers offer WordPress specific hosting plans these days.</p>
            <p class="h5">3. Always stick to SSD type storage and get the storage size which is enough for your website content.</p>
            <p class="h5">4. Try to get a hosting plan without any resource and traffic limits. It seems as an unimportant detail when you first buy a hosting plan to build your website. But it will certainly create an extra headache when it comes to scaling up your website. Your increased traffic will hit the bandwidth limit or the hosting provider will charge you extra money for exceeding your traffic limit.</p>
            <p class="h5">5. If you are buying a VPS or dedicated server hosting, check the included processor and memory capacities. Just like a personal computer, higher RAM memory and processor level will increase the speed and processing power of your VPS server. Get at least 2 vCPUs and 2 GiB of total RAM memory to be able to survive and handle your daily traffic properly in this modern age of technology.</p>
            <p class="h5">6. Buy a web hosting package includes as many website products as possible. For example, one domain name and a couple of email accounts are usually included in most web hosting plans.</p>
            <p class="h5">7. Do not buy expensive hosting plans. Make a market price research beforehand. For instance, a shared hosting plans are usually priced between $20 and $60 per year.</p>
            <p class="h5">8. Prefer one of the most popular and reputable hosting providers if the price range is suitable for you.</p>

          <p class="aln cor h2 text-danger">Is a WordPress hosting same with a shared hosting?</p>
          <p class="aln cor h5">Yes, usually a WordPress hosting is a shared hosting plan with WordPress installed beforehand. But you can also install WordPress content management system in your VPS or dedicated server hosting plans.</p>
          <p class="aln cor h5">You are not allowed to install any software on a shared hosting. That is why web hosting providers install WordPress CMS in a shared hosting and call it WordPress hosting.</p>
          <br/>
          <p class="aln cor h2 text-danger">Is it compulsory to use content management systems when you buy a shared hosting?</p>
          <p class="aln cor h5">No. If you are a Developer or you have coding skills, you can develop your own website. Most of the shared hosting providers a build specific environment for each of popular programming languages where you can develop and run scripts and microservices.</p>
          <p class="aln cor h5">They usually provide support for <b>Python</b>, <b>Java</b>, <b>PHP</b>, <b>C</b>, <b>.NET</b>, <b>Perl</b>, <b>Golang</b>, and other popular programming languages.</p>
          <br/>
          <p class="aln cor h2 text-danger">If I need root access to my server, which hosting plan is the best for me?</p>
          <p class="aln cor h5">If you need to connect to your server through SSH as a root user (shell access) in order to install different packages or make server configurations, you should definitely go with VPS or dedicated hosting plans.</p>
          <p class="aln cor h5">Most of the shared hosting providers does not provide root access (shell access) to clients due to security and privacy concerns.</p>
