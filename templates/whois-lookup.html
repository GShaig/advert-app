            <h2 class="text-primary">What is WHOIS Lookup?</h2>
            <p class="h5">WHOIS is a database where you can find information about all the registered domain names and IP addresses. The information includes the domain owner, registered address, contact details, date of registration etc.</p>
            <p class="h5">WHOIS Lookup tool sends a query to WHOIS database with requested domain name which in response you get all the information mentioned below. When you wish to buy a registered domain name, you can check WHOIS database to see the domain owner and contact details in order to reach the domain owner and try to negotiate about the price of the domain name.</p>
            <p class="h5">You can learn below information from a WHOIS lookup:</p>
            <p class="h5">- The name of the domain owner or the registrar company.</p>
            <p class="h5">- The contact information of the domain owner or the registrar company.</p>
            <p class="h5">- The date of registration.</p>
            <p class="h5">- The date of expiration.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Name servers. The servers where the domain name is hosted.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Status. Whether the domain is currently active or not.</p>
            <p class="h5">Please note that some domain owners wish to stay anonymous on WHOIS database and purchase domain privacy from their domain registrars. Sometimes you can find only the information about the domain registrar like GoDaddy, Namecheap, Ionos, Bluehost etc. on WHOIS results which means the domain owner probably has got a domain privacy with his/her package.</p>
            <p class="h5">If you would like to hide your identity and contact information from WHOIS results, you should get a domain privacy when you buy your domain. Almost all domain registrars offer a domain privacy during domain name purchases these days.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">Why hide your WHOIS information?</h2>
            <p class="h5">The main reasons why domain owners prefer to hide their information from WHOIS results include preventing strangers spamming their mailboxes, business and strategic reasons, not to reveal residential address or other privacy issues.</p>
            <p class="h5">Not all the domain registrars provide domain privacy service. Some of them provide domain privacy as an extra service which you can add to your package and some registrars provide the service free of charge. Our domain registrar <a class="text-decoration-none fw-bold" href="https://namecheap.pxf.io/2rZ2gG">Namecheap</a> provides domain privacy service free of charge. You just need to login to your account and enable the service for your domain.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="text-primary">WHOIS Lookup by IP Address</h2>
            <p class="h5">You can also perform a WHOIS Lookup with entering an IP address. The tool will still show the corresponding information about the provided IP address. Though the information provided in WHOIS lookups by IP address is a little different than a normal domain name lookups.</p>
            <p class="h5">Some technical information such as net range, CIDR, net name, net handle etc. will also be included in the check results. All these details are specific to IP address lookups and will not be shown on normal domain name lookups.</p>
            <p class="h5">Please note that a typical IP address lookup does not include the technical properties of the device associated with the IP address. An IP lookup result normally includes only IP-related technical terms such as the organisation the IP address allocated to and the referral server.</p>
            <p class="h5">Please do not forget that you can only perform a search for IPv4 type IP addresses. IPv6 type IP addresses are not supported by our WHOIS Lookup tool, yet. For more information about IP addresses, please visit What is an IP address page.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2 class="text-primary">Redacted for Privacy</h2>
            <p class="h5">If you see <b>Redacted for Privacy</b> phrase in any section on WHOIS lookup results that means the domain owner has enabled a domain privacy for that section. If this is the case, a small piece of information available on the check results usually belongs to the domain registrar, not the domain owner.</p>
            <p class="h5">Sometimes it is a good idea to hide your information from WHOIS lookups, especially when you do not want to be disturbed by potential scammers and spammers.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">When we need to use WHOIS lookup?</h2>
            <p class="h5">- Learn the domain owner and contact details: Learning the name and contact details of the domain owner serves many purposes. One of the main purposes can be trying to contact the domain owner in order to buy the domain name. Another reason can be to find out if a website is the official website of a company or it is a third party / fake website.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Check the domain expiry: Obviously checking the domain expiry is for finding out whether if the domain name expires soon or not. Because if the domain will be expired soon, then we can act quickly and buy the domain name.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Find out the domain name servers: This information is mostly useful for developers and experienced people about domain names. You can check a domain name servers to find out exactly where the domain name is hosted.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Check the registrar company: Find out the domain registrar is also important in terms of knowing who manages the domain name. Because in some cases a domain registrar registers the domain more than their clients ask for. For instance, a client buys a domain for 2 years, but the domain registrar reserves the domain for 3 year. In this situation, even though the domain is shown as registered on WHOIS lookup results, you probably can still buy the domain from the domain registrar.</p>
            <p class="h5">- Identify the domain age: Domain age is very important factor especially for SEO ranking and other success factors such as high traffic. WHOIS lookup will show the first creation date of a domain name and you can calculate the age of the domain easily. Again, the older domain, the better performance for you.</p>

            <h2 class="text-primary">What is WHOIS history lookup and why we need it?</h2>
            <p class="h5">WHOIS history lookup is a collection of WHOIS lookups for a specific domain name recorded especially when a significant update has been made on domain information or the domain ownership has been changed. It is especially important from the cyber security perspective.</p>
            <p class="h5">This record also helps people who are thinking about getting a domain name by providing the WHOIS snapshots of a specific domain name by time.</p>
            <p class="h5">If you perform a normal WHOIS lookup for the domain you are thinking about to buy, you can check only the current owner and up-to-date data about the domain. But in order to be on the safe side, you will have to check the previous owners and data for the domain as well. It is advised to do so that to be sure of that the domain has not been used in scam or phishing activities by cyber criminals.</p>
            <p class="h5">This is also important for domain registrar. When registering domain names for their customers, they must be aware of any suspicious activity the domain name has been engaged in before their purchase.</p>

These status codes show the availability of four actions: <i>Transfer</i>, <i>Update</i>, <i>Renew</i>, and <i>Delete.
