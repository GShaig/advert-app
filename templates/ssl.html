            <h2 class="text-primary">Important steps when buying your SSL certificate.</h2>
            <p class="h5">1. Choose your preferred SSL certificate type. Please consider the tips mentioned above for this step.</p>
            <p class="h5">2. Make a research and decide on your SSL certificate provider. Each service provider has its own plans and benefits.</p>
            <p class="h5">3. Go to your SSL certificate provider's website and find the plan with your preferred SSL certificate. Press the <b>BUY</b> button next to the plan.</p>
            <p class="h5">4. Select your preferred timeframe for your SSL certificate expiry. Most service providers offer between one year and five years for validity of the SSL certificate. Please note that the service providers usually issues the certificate for one year and renew it after each year if you bought the certificate for more than one year.</p>
            <p class="h5">5. Complete the SSL certificate registration form. The most important part in this form is the section where you specify your domain name for which you are buying the SSL certificate. Please do not forget to include <i>*.yourdomain.com</i> as well if you want to buy a wildcard SSL certificate.</p>
            <p class="h5">6. Choose your preferred payment method and pay the amount. Payment methods usually include Visa / Mastercard Debit / Credit card payment, Paypal, crypto payment etc.</p>
            <p class="h5">7. Wait for a confirmation email after you make your payment. Look for a link in that email which will direct you to the management dashboard where you can install your SSL certificate.</p>
            <p class="h5">8. If your domain name registrar and SSL certificate provider is the same company, do not worry after purchase of your SSL certificate. The certificate will automatically be applied to your domain and you can visit your site with <b>https</b> prefix.</p>
            <p class="h5">9. But if your domain registrar and SSL certificate provider are different companies, then you will need to install your SSL certificate into your web server manually.

          <br/>
          <p class="aln cor h2 text-danger">How can I know what type of SSL Certificate I need?</p>
          <p class="aln cor h5">Simply use our SSL Certificate Advisor tool. Answer the questions and the advisor will show the best option for you.</p>
          <br/>
          <p class="aln cor h2 text-danger">Why the tool asks if I use multiple servers with a single domain?</p>
          <p class="aln cor h5">Because multiple servers are usually represented as subdomains of the root domain. Requests sent to each subdomain are to be directed to the corresponded backend server.</p>
          <p class="aln cor h5">If this is the case, you will need a wildcard SSL certificate in order to cover all of your subdomains.</p>
          <br/>
          <p class="aln cor h2 text-danger">I have just an informative or a blog website. Do I need an SSL certificate?</p>
          <p class="aln cor h5">SSL certificate is not just for data encryption. Having SSL certificate also increases your SEO ranking and therefore brings more visitors to your website.</p>
          <p class="aln cor h5">Plus missing SSL certificate will make your website shown as <b>Not Secure</b> in most internet browsers. This situation can scare away your day-to-day website visitors.</p>
          <br/>
          <p class="aln cor h2 text-danger">Does a wildcard SSL certificate cover my root domain?</p>
          <p class="aln cor h5">No, wildcard SSL certificates usually do not cover root domains. You should explicitly include your root domain in the same SSL certificate.</p>
